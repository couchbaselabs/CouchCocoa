    The properties dictionary needs to contain a "_rev" key whose value is the current revision's ID; the dictionary returned by -properties will already have this, so if you modify that dictionary you're OK. The exception is if this is a new document, as there is no current revision, so no "_rev" key is needed.
    If the PUT succeeds, the operation's resultObject will be set to the new CouchRevision.
    You should be prepared for the operation to fail with a 412 status, indicating that a newer revision has already been added by another client.
    In this case you need to call -currentRevision again, to get that newer revision, incorporate any changes into your properties dictionary, and try again. (This is not the same as a conflict resulting from synchronization. Those conflicts result in multiple versions of a document appearing in the database; but in this case, you were prevented from creating a conflict.) */
